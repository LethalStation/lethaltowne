A quick note on the balance vision for LETHALTOWNE's:

ADVENTURERS are weaker than most other codebases by design, to give them more headroom for advancement. Most advclasses should receive low tier weaponry,
incomplete sets of low tier armor, and limited roundstart tools. Stats should be balanced around having +2 or +3/-1 at roundstart. Stronger stats like STR and SPD
may be offset with a negative stat somewhere else. Skills should not be higher than Expert, and Expert skills should not be very common in their loadout. Combat
related feats like dodge expertise and armor training are generally intended to be held in reserve so that they can be granted as a part of an item set or granted
by looted objects. Keep in mind that wearing armor without expertise only means the player cannot run, jump, and dodge in it, so it's viable to give a class armor
they aren't trained in as part of the trade off of their roundstart balance. They get unlimited slots.

Small exceptions to the general rule are made for the PSYDON exclusive classes, which are current: Warscholar, Confessor, Adjudicator, and Inquisitor. This is because
they are locked out of the LUX-based progression system that allows other characters to increase their stats mid-round. Instead, they are required to seek the lux of
heretics specifically, which can be used to purchase relic weaponry. Similarly, ASCENDANT adventurer subclasses may be tuned slightly higher due to having the additional
stigma of heresy putting them naturally at odds with PSYDONic characters. PSYDONic classes receive +5 or +6/-1 stats and may have better gear and skills.

Lastly, advclasses should have minimal crafting skills, which will be handled by villagers.

VILLAGERS are straightforward noncombat roles intended for players who want to have chill rounds in the village. They should remain a fairly small faction focused on
core economic functions, like making equipment or producing food. Since they aren't balanced around combat what they do receive isn't as important as a consideration,
so long as they have enough "stuff" to bootstrap themselves into an economically stable position for a multi hour round. The lethaltowne economy will be subject to more
resource scarcity that most other servers, so starting them off with enough ingots or hides or whatever to start bartering with the adventurers and other towners is good.

The final LETHALTOWNE faction are the BALEFUL WRETCHES, a tiny faction of boss-level antagonistic players patron locked to the ASCENDANTS. These should be formidable
challenges even for late stage player strength, and should have good enough equipment with varied enough options that the players won't be interested in looting the
dungeon themselves; they are effectively named wandering bosses and should act and be balanced as such. Go nuts. They get limited slots that do not refill after death.
